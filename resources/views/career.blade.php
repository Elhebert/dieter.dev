            <p>
                I studied IT System and Network Administration in Belgium and did one year of Computer Engineering in Ireland. I don't really remember what I learned. But it got me into web development, so I guess it was worth it.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started my career by working for a TelCo company. For a year I worked on legacy PHP system. When I say legacy I mean legacy. It was a PHP 5.3 codebase that was about 10 years old. It had a single folder containing  over 1000 php files without consistent linting or coding style. ðŸ¤®
            </p>

            <p>
                After that I joined a startup. It was created by the CEO and CTO of 3D design company. They wanted to create a SAAS platform for project handling (task management, invoicing, etc...). But it became clear very quick to me that they had no idea on how tech works. Every other week they would ask to remove or add a feature. In the 6 months I worked there we had nothing to show for it. That's when I decided to leave.
            </p>

            <p>
                I then joined a marketing agency, Altavia ACT, specialized in big retailers (Carrefour, Tom & Co, Metro, Badoit, etc...). On top of creating different kind of websites for them I also took over the whole releasing pipeline. When I joined they had a single server with over 150 websites. When I left they had a single Digital Ocean instance per site with automated provisioning and deployment thanks to a series of Ansible and bash scripts which slowly migrated to Laravel Forge.
            </p>

            <p>
                I worked for 2 years for (hotel?) trivago. I was involved in the development of a marketplace platform where independent hoteliers would be able to buy and use tools/apps to manage their properties on trivago: <a class="no-underline hover:underline font-bold text-[#3736C6]" href="https://studio.trivago.com">trivago Business Studio</a>. Most of my days were spent on maintaining the code base, refactor aging APIs and work on the payment and subscription manager.
            </p>


            <p>
                And finally I joined Strapi as a Senior Backend Engineer. Soon after I started to work as a Lead Backend Engineer on <a class="no-underline hover:underline font-bold text-[#3736C6]" href="https://studio.trivago.com">Strapi Cloud</a>. Together with the CTO we build the architecture and put the foundation of the code base that is running Strapi Cloud. My day-to-day consists of mentoring other engineers, being a bridge between our engineering and product teams and to be a steward for the codebase.

We need Dieter's feedbacks as they are very valuable.</x-testimonials>

                    <x-testimonial author="Developer">Dieter share and explain what he has on his mind. During standups, backlog reviews, tech refinement, on Slack, etc...
